# About Agent Docs

The purpose of this directory is to provide context and guidance to the v0 coding agent. It will be saved into the project source code as soon as the application has been created from the initial prompt. The agent and I will need to keep these files updated to accurately reflect the evolution of the project. I'll need to add new requirements in here too as I go. 

This readme file will likely be turned into an index summarising each document and linking to it.
