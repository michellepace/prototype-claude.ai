## Names for Chats and Projects
(aka "titles" - correct terminology to use is "name" )

### Chats are automatically named
- The application will name the chat using the first 90 available characters from the first user message
- Chat names do not need to be unique
- Length: [1, 90] characters

### Projects are NOT automatically named

- Length: [1, 90] characters

### Editing Names: Renaming of Chats and Projects
A user may rename both a chat and a project

### Names can include unicode character symbols
For example:
