**DO NOT CODE - I NEED WELL CONSIDERED ADVICE**

# Claude.ai Prototype Project Specifications

## Core Requirements
- **Tech Stack**: Next.js, TypeScript, shadcn/ui (New York theme, Stone palette), Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Zustand with middleware and sessionStorage (prepared for future Supabase integration)
- **Functionality**: Visual prototype only - all chat inputs return "This is a prototype that looks real, but isn't functional"
- **User Experience**: No authentication required, but UI shows logged-in state

## Scope
1. Main chat interface (primary focus)
2. Chats listing page
3. Projects page
4. User settings page
5. Projects management page
6. Shared modal navigation drawer

## Development Approach
I need guidance on the most effective incremental development strategy:

1. **Initial Prompt Structure Options**:
   - Option A: Start with only the root chat page without state management
   - Option B: Build complete UI with data interfaces and request state management implementation
   - Option C: Implement using feature-based approach with user stories

2. **Documentation Structure**:
   - How to organize the `docs/` directory effectively
   - What documentation is essential for the AI to understand the project
   - How to balance comprehensive documentation with incremental development focus

## Supporting Materials
- UI screenshots for all 5 pages and the navigation drawer will be provided
- TypeScript interfaces are defined and ready

Please recommend the most efficient development approach and documentation structure that will help me build this prototype incrementally while maintaining clarity for the AI agent.
