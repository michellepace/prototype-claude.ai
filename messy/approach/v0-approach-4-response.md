# Claude.ai Prototype Development Strategy

Based on your requirements for a visual prototype of Claude.ai, I'll outline the most effective incremental development approach and documentation structure to help you build this efficiently.

## Recommended Development Approach

I recommend **Option C: Implement using a feature-based approach with user stories**, but with some strategic modifications:

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure & Main Chat Interface

1. **Set up project foundation**
   - Next.js App Router structure with TypeScript
   - Tailwind + shadcn/ui with New York theme and Stone palette
   - Basic Zustand store setup with sessionStorage middleware
   - Global layout with navigation drawer skeleton

2. **Implement main chat interface (MVP)**
   - Focus on the primary UI components without complex state
   - Implement basic message display and input functionality
   - Add the "This is a prototype" response message

This approach gives you a working foundation quickly while establishing the architecture for future components.

### Phase 2: State Management & Navigation

1. **Enhance state management**

   - Implement complete Zustand store with chat history
   - Add mock data interfaces for chats and projects
   - Connect UI components to state

2. **Build navigation system**

   - Complete the navigation drawer
   - Implement routing between pages
   - Add basic layouts for secondary pages

### Phase 3: Secondary Pages & Polish

1. **Implement remaining pages**

   - Chats listing page
   - Projects page
   - Settings page
   - Projects management page

2. **Add final polish**

   - Responsive design refinements
   - Transitions and animations
   - Error states and edge cases

## Documentation

### File Structure

I recommend organizing your `docs/` directory as follows:

```plaintext
docs/
├── architecture/
│   ├── folder-structure.md
│   ├── state-management.md
│   └── component-architecture.md
├── components/
│   ├── chat-interface.md
│   ├── navigation.md
│   └── shared-components.md
├── data/
│   ├── interfaces.ts
│   └── mock-data.ts
├── design/
│   ├── theme-configuration.md
│   └── ui-screenshots/
└── development/
    ├── roadmap.md
    ├── user-stories.md
    └── future-integration-notes.md
```

### Essential Docs

1. **Architecture Overview**
   - High-level explanation of the project structure
   - State management approach with Zustand
   - Component hierarchy and communication patterns

2. **Component Documentation**
   - Purpose and functionality of key components
   - Props interfaces and usage examples
   - State dependencies and interactions

3. **Data Interfaces**
   - TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
   - Mock data examples that match the interfaces
   - Notes on future Supabase integration points

4. **User Stories**
   - Clearly defined user stories for each feature
   - Acceptance criteria for visual prototype functionality
   - Prioritization of features for incremental development

## Implementation Recommendations

1. **Start with a vertical slice**
   - Build one complete feature (chat interface) from UI to state
   - This validates your architecture before expanding horizontally

2. **Use atomic design principles**
   - Build from atoms (buttons, inputs) to molecules (message bubbles) to organisms (chat container)
   - Create a component library that can be reused across pages

3. **Implement responsive design from the start**
   - Follow Tailwind's mobile-first approach
   - Test on multiple viewport sizes throughout development

4. **Separate concerns clearly**
   - UI components should be presentation-only
   - State logic should live in Zustand stores
   - Use custom hooks to connect components to state

5. **Document as you build**
   - Update documentation alongside code changes
   - Include comments explaining complex logic or future integration points

## Folder Structure for Next.js App Router

```plaintext
app/
├── (routes)/
│   ├── chat/
│   │   ├── [id]/
│   │   │   └── page.tsx
│   │   └── page.tsx
│   ├── projects/
│   │   ├── [id]/
│   │   │   └── page.tsx
│   │   └── page.tsx
│   └── settings/
│       └── page.tsx
├── components/
│   ├── chat/
│   ├── navigation/
│   ├── projects/
│   ├── settings/
│   └── ui/
├── hooks/
│   ├── use-chat-store.ts
│   └── use-projects-store.ts
├── lib/
│   └── utils.ts
├── store/
│   ├── chat-store.ts
│   ├── project-store.ts
│   └── middleware.ts
└── types/
    └── index.ts
```

This structure follows Next.js App Router conventions while organizing components by feature, making it easier to locate and maintain related code.

## Balancing Documentation with Development

To balance comprehensive documentation with incremental development:

1. **Document architecture decisions upfront**

   - Core patterns and principles should be established early
   - This prevents rework and ensures consistency

2. **Use lightweight documentation for evolving components**

   - Simple README files in component directories
   - Update as components mature

3. **Prioritize interface documentation**

   - TypeScript interfaces are critical for shared understanding
   - Keep these updated as your data model evolves

4. **Create living documentation**

   - Consider tools like Storybook to document components visually
   - This serves as both documentation and development environment

By following this approach, you'll build a maintainable prototype that can be easily understood and extended, while keeping documentation focused on what matters most at each stage.
