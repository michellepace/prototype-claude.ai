### Building a Claude.ai Prototype: Strategic Approach

I understand your goal of creating a functional prototype that mimics Claude.ai's user experience without the actual AI functionality. Let me provide some structured advice on how to approach this project effectively.

## Initial Prompt Strategy

For your initial prompt, I recommend a hybrid approach that combines elements of your options but with a clear focus:

Recommended Initial Prompt Structure:

```
#### 1. Project Setup & Architecture
1. Next.js App Router setup with the correct folder structure
2. Tailwind and shadcn/ui configuration with the New York style and Stone palette
3. Basic layout components that will be shared across pages
4. Core TypeScript interfaces for your data models

#### 2. Navigation Framework
1. Implement the shared modal drawer navigation
2. Set up the basic routing structure for all pages
3. Create placeholder pages with minimal content

#### 3. State Management Foundation
1. Basic Zustand store setup with sessionStorage middleware
2. Core state slices for user, chats, and projects
```

This approach gives you a solid foundation that's functional but not overwhelming, allowing you to iterate on specific features later.

## Documentation Structure

I recommend creating a structured `docs/` folder with these key files:

```plaintext
docs/
├── project-overview.md       # High-level project description and goals
├── architecture.md           # Technical architecture decisions
├── data-models.md            # TypeScript interfaces and data structures
├── best-practices.md         # Coding standards and patterns to follow
├── features/                 # Folder for feature documentation
│   ├── chat.md               # Chat feature requirements and implementation notes
│   ├── projects.md           # Projects feature requirements
│   ├── settings.md           # User settings feature requirements
│   └── navigation.md         # Navigation system requirements
└── roadmap.md                # Implementation plan and progress tracking
```

## Feature Documentation Template

For each feature document, use a consistent structure:

```markdown
# Feature: [Name]

## Overview
Brief description of the feature

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to [action], so that [benefit]
- As a user, I want to [action], so that [benefit]

## UI Components
- ComponentA: Purpose and behavior
- ComponentB: Purpose and behavior

## State Requirements
- What data needs to be stored
- How it interacts with other features

## Implementation Status
- [x] Basic UI implemented
- [ ] State management connected
- [ ] Interactions working
```

## Implementation Strategy

I recommend this iterative approach:

### Phase 1: Core Structure
- Set up the project with proper configuration
- Implement the navigation framework
- Create placeholder pages with minimal styling

### Phase 2: UI Implementation**
- Implement the UI for each page based on screenshots
- Focus on responsive design and component structure
- Ensure the visual design matches Claude.ai

### Phase 3: State Management**
- Connect Zustand stores to UI components
- Implement mock data and responses
- Add persistence with sessionStorage

### Phase 4: Interactions**
- Add animations and transitions
- Implement the chat response mechanism
- Polish the user experience

## Keeping Docs Updated

To keep documentation in sync with your implementation:

Progress Tracking
- Update the `roadmap.md` file after completing each feature
- Use checkboxes in feature documents to track progress

Doc-Driven Development
- Write or update documentation before implementing a feature
- Reference documentation in your prompts to the coding agent

Changelog
- Add a `changelog.md` file to track major changes
- Update it after each significant implementation milestone

## Specific Recommendations

1. Start with the main chat interface as your first feature since it's the core experience
2. Implement the navigation drawer early as it's shared across all pages
3. Create a consistent layout component that all pages will use
4. Define your TypeScript interfaces upfront to guide implementation
5. Use Zustand actions to simulate responses in the chat


This approach will help you build incrementally while maintaining a clear vision of the complete prototype.

## Phases vs. Features: Clarification

Phases and features serve different purposes in project planning:

- **Features** are distinct functionalities or components of your application (chat interface, navigation drawer, etc.)
- **Phases** are strategic groupings of implementation work organized by dependency and complexity, helping you build incrementally in a logical order


Phases provide a high-level roadmap that ensures you're building components in the right sequence, while features describe the actual functionality you're implementing. Think of phases as your strategic timeline and features as the building blocks.

Here are the phases with their features in markdown format:

```markdown
# Phase 1: Core Structure

## Features
- Project Setup (Next.js, Tailwind, shadcn/ui with New York style and Stone palette)
- Basic Layout Framework (shared layout components)
- Navigation System (drawer and page routing)
- TypeScript Interface Definitions
- Basic Zustand Store Configuration

## Purpose
Establish the technical foundation and navigation framework that all other features will build upon. This phase focuses on architecture rather than detailed UI implementation.
```

```markdown
# Phase 2: UI Implementation

## Features
- Chat Interface (message list, input area, chat controls)
- Projects UI (project list, creation modal)
- Settings UI (user preferences panels)
- Responsive Design Implementation
- Theme Configuration

## Purpose
Build out the visual components of all major screens based on the Claude.ai screenshots, focusing on appearance rather than functionality. This phase creates the "look and feel" of the application.
```

```markdown
# Phase 3: State Management

## Features
- Chat State (message history, active chat)
- Projects State (project list, active project)
- User Settings State
- Session Persistence
- Mock Response System

## Purpose
Connect the UI components to state management, implement data persistence, and create the simulated response system that will return the placeholder message.
```

```markdown
# Phase 4: Interactions & Polish

## Features
- Animations and Transitions
- Loading States
- Error Handling
- Responsive Behavior Refinement
- Accessibility Improvements

## Purpose
Add the interactive elements that make the prototype feel real and polished, focusing on the details that create a seamless user experience.
```

For each feature within these phases, you would then define specific user stories that describe the functionality from the user's perspective. For example:

```markdown
## Feature: Chat Interface

### User Stories
- As a user, I want to see my previous messages in a conversation, so I can review the context
- As a user, I want to send a new message and see the prototype response, so I can simulate a conversation
- As a user, I want to start a new chat, so I can begin a fresh conversation
- As a user, I want to see typing indicators, so the interface feels responsive
```

This hierarchical approach (Phases → Features → User Stories) provides a clear roadmap for implementation while keeping the work organized and manageable.
