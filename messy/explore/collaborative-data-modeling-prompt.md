# Next.js Data Interface Development Prompt

I'm sharing documentation for my Next.js web application that's in the planning phase. I need your help to analyse my project requirements and define comprehensive data interfaces that will support all necessary functionality.

## Documentation Context
I'll provide multiple resources:
1. README.md - Primary description of the project, requirements, and functionality
2. ref-data-model.md - Initial attempt at defining data interfaces (contains structural guidance but has errors and gaps)
3. ref-zustand-architecture.md - Extension related to state management
4. UI Screenshots - Visual designs of the entire application with mock data included

## Your Task
Please approach this as a collaborative data modeling exercise:

1. **Use README.md as your primary source** - Thoroughly analyse the project requirements in the README to identify all necessary data entities, relationships, and interfaces.

2. **Request specific resources as needed** - You may ask for any of the documentation files or UI screenshots at any point in our conversation. Feel free to request all UI screenshots or specific ones based on your current focus area.

3. **Ask clarifying questions one by one** - After reviewing the documentation, ask me specific questions one at a time to confirm requirements and clarify aspects that impact the data model. Wait for my response to each question before proceeding to the next.

4. **Reference, don't depend on ref-data-model.md** - Use my existing data model file only as a structural reference and naming convention guide. Don't be constrained by its errors or omissions.

5. **Develop comprehensive interfaces** - Based on our discussion and your analysis, create a complete set of TypeScript interfaces that properly support all application requirements.

6. **Consider state management integration** - Ensure the data model will work effectively with the Zustand approach outlined in ref-zustand-architecture.md.

## Response Approach
Begin by requesting the README and any initial resources you feel are necessary. After reviewing, proceed with asking clarifying questions one by one and requesting additional resources (including UI screenshots) as needed to understand specific aspects of the application. After we've addressed key requirements through this dialogue, provide your recommended data interfaces.

Remember that I'm looking for a thorough analysis based primarily on the README and UI screenshots, with thoughtful questions to fill any gaps in understanding, rather than simply refining what exists in ref-data-model.md.
