# Next.js Data Interface Development Prompt

I'm sharing documentation for my Next.js web application that's in the planning phase. I need your help to analyse my project requirements and define comprehensive data interfaces that will support all necessary functionality.

## Documentation Context
I'll provide three documents:
1. README.md - Primary description of the project, requirements, and functionality
2. ref-data-model.md - Initial attempt at defining data interfaces (contains structural guidance but has errors and gaps)
3. ref-zustand-architecture.md - Extension related to state management

## Your Task
Please approach this as a collaborative data modelling exercise:

1. **Use README.md as your primary source** - Thoroughly analyse the project requirements in the README to identify all necessary data entities, relationships, and interfaces.

2. **Ask clarifying questions one by one** - After reviewing the documentation, ask me specific questions one at a time to confirm requirements and clarify aspects that impact the data model. Wait for my response to each question before proceeding to the next.

3. **Reference, don't depend on ref-data-model.md** - Use my existing data model file only as a structural reference and naming convention guide. Don't be constrained by its errors or omissions.

4. **Develop comprehensive interfaces** - Based on our discussion and your analysis, create a complete set of TypeScript interfaces that properly support all application requirements.

5. **Consider state management integration** - Ensure the data model will work effectively with the Zustand approach outlined in ref-zustand-architecture.md.

## Response Approach
Begin by thoroughly reviewing the README, then proceed with asking clarifying questions one at a time. After we've addressed key requirements through this dialogue, provide your recommended data interfaces.

Remember that I'm looking for a thorough analysis based primarily on the README, with thoughtful questions to fill any gaps in understanding, rather than simply refining what exists in ref-data-model.md.
